## Introducing Diversity In Feature Scatter Adversarial Training Via Synthesis 
*Abstract*
In an attempt to understand how deep learning models
interpret inputs, it has been found that they change their
prediction when a carefully optimized imperceptible noise
termed adversarial perturbation is added to the input data.
Many researchers are focusing on developing methods to
counter such effects, but such methods do not generalize
well to adversarial test data. Recently, Feature-Scatter
adversarial training has come up to solve such problems,
but this method uses the traditional adversarial training
framework as its basis that cannot generate diverse
perturbations.

In this paper, we propose an approach that combines both
the Feature-Scatter adversarial training and the
generator-based adversarial training framework to optimally
explore the adversarial data manifold achieving better
robust generalization. We perform extensive experimentation
across a wide variety of datasets such as Cifar10,
Cifar100, and SVHN. Our framework significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods against both strong white-box
attacks and black-box attacks.
